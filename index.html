        <p>
            I have been on a journey seeking meaning and opportunities to celebrate and uplift
            people and communities. It's been wildly unorthodox so far.

            Currently learning how to be a great software engineer. I had a fun stint cooking
            technology and K-12 state reporting compliance using automation and data
            validation methods.

            Broad, broad interests in: Tanzania, education, health, social networks,
            and natural language processing (NLP). Iâ€™ve never been much of an
            inventor, but I feel like George Washington Carver on this keyboard.
